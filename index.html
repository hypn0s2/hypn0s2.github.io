            <h2>Recent Cybersecurity Threats in 2025</h2>
            <p>In 2025, cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly. Ransomware attacks have become more sophisticated, targeting not only large corporations but also small businesses and individuals. The rise of AI-driven attacks has also posed new challenges for cybersecurity professionals.</p>
            <p>One notable trend is the increase in supply chain attacks, where attackers compromise software updates or third-party services to infiltrate target networks. Organizations are now focusing more on zero-trust architectures and continuous monitoring to mitigate these risks.</p>

            <h2>The Role of AI in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a dual role in cybersecurity. On one hand, AI-powered tools are helping organizations detect and respond to threats more quickly. On the other hand, cybercriminals are using AI to automate attacks and evade traditional security measures.</p>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to analyze vast amounts of data and identify anomalies that could indicate an important breach. However, the arms race between AI-driven defense and offense continues to escalate.</p>
